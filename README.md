## Description

# skeleton-loaders
I have implemented loading feature by displaying skeletons of the data that will be loaded.

# redux-thunk
Redux store is now sitting between BE and React, hence acting like a frontend middleware.
React.js makes no calls to any data or api

# api
Since there is no BE, I am currenty mocking the data from some dummy folder.
Since redux is handling the api calls, I have commented in actions.ts where the actual api call would happen.
For demonstration purposes, adding an invoice is handled locally
